                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            </article>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions, and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");

            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.</p>

        <!-- Declaring variables section -->
        <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                    <code>var x = 42;</code>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>x = 42;</code>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
                    this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,
                    <code>let y = 13;</code>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <!-- Variable scope section  -->
        <section id="variable_scope" class="main-section">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example:</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; }</code>
                <p>The variable <code>x</code> is accessible outside the block in which it was declared.</p>

        <section id="global_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>Global variables are accessible from any function or block in your code. However, excessive use of global variables can lead to conflicts and unpredictable behavior in your code.</p>
                <p>To declare a global variable, simply define it outside of any function:</p>
                <code>var globalVar = "I'm global!";</code>

            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the <code>let</code> keyword. The <code>const</code> declaration creates a constant whose scope is limited to the block in which it is declared.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <code>const pi = 3.14;</code>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript has dynamic types. You don't need to declare the data type when you create a variable. For example:</p>
                <code>let number = 42;</code>

            <article>
                <p>The <code>if...else</code> statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition:</p>
                <code>if (condition) { /* code to execute if condition is true */ } else { /* code to execute if condition is false */ }</code>

                <p>The <code>while</code> statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true:</p>
